4. OpenMP prime number generation with time comparison
Q: How do you find all primes from 1 to n using OpenMP and record execution time?
 A: Use a parallelized for-loop with #pragma omp parallel for to test primality and compare execution time with sequential code using omp_get_wtime().

5. MPI send & receive
Q: How do you demonstrate MPI_Send and MPI_Recv?
 A: Write a program where Process 0 sends data to Process 1 using MPI_Send() and Process 1 receives it with MPI_Recv() and prints acknowledgment.

6. MPI program to show and avoid deadlock
Q: How is deadlock demonstrated using MPI point-to-point communication and how is it avoided?
 A: Create two processes where both wait on MPI_Recv() first causing deadlock, then fix it by altering order (send first or use MPI_Sendrecv).

7. MPI Broadcast
Q: How do you write an MPI program to demonstrate broadcast?
 A: Use MPI_Bcast() to send a value from the root process to all other processes and print data at each rank to check uniform distribution.

8. MPI Scatter and Gather
Q: How do you demonstrate MPI_Scatter and MPI_Gather?
 A: Use MPI_Scatter() to distribute array chunks to each process and MPI_Gather() to collect processed results back to the root.

9. MPI Reduce & Allreduce
Q: How do you demonstrate MPI_Reduce and MPI_Allreduce using max, min, sum, product?
 A: Perform reduction operations such as MPI_SUM, MPI_MAX, etc. using MPI_Reduce() on all ranks and compare the global output with MPI_Allreduce() which returns result to all processes.

Here are additional one–two-statement Question and Answer pairs based on the same topics:

🔹 OpenMP – Mergesort & Performance
Q: Why is parallel mergesort faster for large input arrays compared to sequential?
 A: Parallel mergesort divides sorting work across threads allowing simultaneous sub-problem execution, reducing overall runtime for large input sizes.

Q: How can you verify thread distribution across loop iterations?
 A: Print thread ID along with iteration number inside the parallel for loop.

🔹 OpenMP Fibonacci Using Tasks
Q: Why are tasks preferred for recursive Fibonacci computation?
 A: Tasks dynamically distribute recursive calls across threads improving parallelism.

 A: The rank value obtained from MPI_Comm_rank().

🔹 MPI Deadlock Demonstration
Q: What causes deadlock in point-to-point MPI programs?
 A: When both processes wait for MPI_Recv() without sending first.

 A: The root parameter.
Q: Why is broadcast useful in parallel programs?
 A: It distributes common input to all processes simultaneously, reducing repetitive communication.

🔹 MPI Scatter/Gather
Q: How does MPI_Scatter differ from MPI_Bcast?
 A: Scatter sends different parts of an array to each process, while broadcast sends the entire data to all.

 A: MPI_Gather().

🔹 MPI Reduce & Allreduce
Q: What is the difference between MPI_Reduce() and MPI_Allreduce()?

Q: Which collective functions can compute sum, min, max and product?
 A: Both MPI_Reduce() and MPI_Allreduce() using operators like MPI_SUM, MPI_MAX, etc.
